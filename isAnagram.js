// An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.  An anagram does not have to have the same meaning as the original word or phrase.

//Examples
// cat - act
//listen - silent
//triangle - integral
//Statue of Liberty - Built to stay free

function isAnagram(str1, str2) {}

console.log(isAnagram("listen", "silent"));
