// Let's call happy numbers those that, as a result of a series of transformations of the form 'sum of the squares of digits', will turn into one. For example, for the number 7, the transformation chain will look like this:

//Examples

// 7   => 7^2 = 49,
// 49  => 4^2 + 9^2 = 16 + 81 = 97,
// 97  => 9^2 + 7^2 = 81 + 49 = 130,
// 130 => 1^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 = 10,
// 10  => 1^2 + 0^2 = 1.

// Conclusion: number 7 - is happy.

function isHappyNumber(num) {}

console.log(isHappyNumber(7));
